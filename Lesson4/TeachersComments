Well done!

a) -0.5
Where is the answer?
b)-1
First of all, you can insert both rows in one statement.
Secondly, you're inserting hardcoded rows (they are constantas). You needed to do it from select.
f)-1
You forgot to added order by DESC. You got wrong result.
It would be better to use the view in this query, not it's inner code. You can just use ...FROM Sales.vSalesPerson.
g)-0.25
Your code is not working because of miising END at the end. I think, you just lost in copying and pasting, but be careful! :)
